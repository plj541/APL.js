 <title>Design Pages with APL.js</title>

</head><body>
This page describes the workspace 1 Html which provides nouns and verbs to
design, display, and test web pages from the APL development environment.
There is also Run.html which allows you to host your web pages without the
users having to learn APL.
In addition to creating the page layout and the handling of events in fields,
there are also tools to save information for subsequent processing.<p>

When you click on <a href="../Run.html">Demo</a>, you will 
see a page with seven labels, eight ordinary text boxes, one multi-line
text box, four check boxes and one drop down list box.  Additionally,
there are buttons labeled:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">Load</td>
<td width="642">fills the text fields with random numbers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clear</td><td>resets all the fields</td></tr>
<tr><td>Save</td><td>saves the current field values, which will be
displayed then next time you try the application</td></tr>
<tr><td>#Debug</td>
<td>evaluates an APL expression, useful to test verbs which<br>
are only useful inside a web page</td></tr></table><p>

The eight Text fields log what happens as you type.  Additionaly,
a sample noun "newList" is provided to demonstrate rewriting the
content of fields such as a listbox.<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">Press</td><td width="642">#Debug</td></tr>
<tr><td width="142">then type</td><td width="642">newList</td></tr>
</table><br>
then look into the drop down list box to see what happened.<p>

To begin learning how this works, either download and install<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://plj541.github.io/Tools/APL.js.zip">APL.js.zip</a><br>
or just click on the web version:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://plj541.github.io/APL.js/">APL.js</a>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">then enter</td>
<td width="642">)fetch APL/Demo</td></tr>
<tr><td>then enter</td><td>)load testHtml</td></tr>
<tr><td>then enter</td><td>)edit</td></tr></table><p>

Look at the noun Example to learn how the screen was created.
There are three reserved noun names which the web page calls:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">onDefine</td>
<td width="642">is called to provide the HTML fields.  Verbs to access<br>
attributes of fields are not available until onLoad is called.</td></tr>
<tr><td>onLoad</td>
<td>runs before the user has access.  This provides<br>
an opportunity to initialize fields</td></tr>
<tr><td>onUnload</td>
<td>runs when the form in unloading.  This provides an<br>
opportunity to save fields.<br>
Unfortunately not all browsers call this event,<br>
so pressing a Save button is more reliable.</td></tr>
</table><p> 

Much of the functionality is provided by the initial line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#include Html<br>
To learn what that does:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)load 1 Html<p>

First look at the verbs which create each type of field:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">Button</td>
<td width="642">'Visual Label'</td></tr>
<tr><td>Text</td><td>1 number (which defines size)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br>
2 numbers (which defines rows and cols)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Check</td><td>'pair' 'Label Pair'</td></tr>
<tr><td>List</td><td>('pair' 'Label Pair') ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Handle</td><td>'idName' 'onCondition:yourHandler'<br>
transforms left arguments for any of the above, this<br>
verb is not called directly by users.  If only one value<br>
is provided, the presence of ":" identifies what it is.<br>
On conditions are defined by Javascript,<br>
but handlers do not have reserved names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Table</td>
<td>turns a matrix into an HTML table.<br>
Every field verb creates a scalar result, which makes<br>
putting them together as a matrix easy.</td></tr>
</table><p>         
				   
The following verbs get or set fields with the ID right argument:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">Values</td>
<td width="642">returns "value" from fields,<br>
or with a left argument, sets a new value or values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Checks</td>
<td>returns "checked" as booleans from fields<br>
or with a left argument, sets the checked state.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Defines</td>
<td>returns "innerHTML" from fields,<br>
or with a left argument, sets the innerHTML.</td></tr>
</table><p>
			
Inside an event handler, the following verbs get or set an attribute:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">Field</td>
<td width="642">returns an attribute (like 'value') of the current field,<br>
or with a left argument, sets the attribute</td></tr>
<tr><td>Event</td>
<td>returns an attribute (like 'keyCode') of the current event<br>
or with a left argument, sets the attribute<br>
I'm not sure you can assign an event attribute,<br>
this is for completeness.</td></tr>
</table><p>

In the demo testHtml, the eight Text fields call "sampleEvent" in
the onkeypress event.  That noun prepends the log of events to the
multi-line Text field at the bottom of the form.<p>

If you make any changes, to test their effect:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">First type</td><td width="642">)save testHtml</td></tr>
<tr><td width="142">then type</td><td width="642">go</td></tr>
</table><p>

Once you are ready to release your web page:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td width="142">First type</td><td width="642">)load 1 Host</td></tr>
<tr><td width="142">then type</td><td width="642">Save 'testHtml'</td></tr>
</table><br>
Then move the file testHtml.jsa to the directory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APL.js.User<br>
which you must create in the same directory where
you put APL.js.<p>

To publish your product on the web, put both APL.js and your
APL.js.User files where people can access them.  Then provide
a link to:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://yourPath/APL.js/Run.html?Page=yourPage
