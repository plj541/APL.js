The visual keyboard only responds to pressing the real SHIFT or ALT
keys.  To actually transmit the visible character, one must click
the desired image.  For further details on the keyboard, see the

The monadic execute verb (⍎) is not aware of its context,
so it is mostly useful in transforming character input into numbers.<p>

Dyadic execute is aware of the global context.  The result is from
evaluating the right argument.  If evaluating the right argument fails,
the result is from evaluating the left argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⎕Error<br>
is provided to discover the reason for failure within the right
argument.<p>

QuoteQuad (⍞) output can be used to establish a prompt.
Output with more than one line will establish a prompt and an initial
value.  See QuoteQuad in 1 Examples for details on how this works.<p>

Quad and QuoteQuad input are not distinguished.  Use:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍎⎕<br>
to provide evaluated input without access to your name space,
or use:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''⍎⎕<br>
to provide access to your global name space.<p>

The system noun, ⎕CT is implemented in this version.  For
compatability with NGN APL, the initial value is 0.  The noun is
global and can have values between 0 and 1e¯10.  Since I know 
nothing about complex numbers, I have not extended ⎕CT
support for those.  You will see examples for dyadic ⍳, ∊ and ≡
in 1 Comparisons.  Please be advised, these verbs are slow.<p>

Indexing of numeric vectors behaves like strand notation, and fails.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 20 30 40 [0 2]<br>
LENGTH ERROR<br>
Instead, use:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10 20 30 40)[0 2]<p>

Overtake on empties does not preserve type.  All empties are
presumed to be numeric.  To test for character arguments, you
need to be creative.  I currently use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' '∊2↑1⍴⍺<p>

Adverbs and Conjunctions are recognized by the presence of
reserved names.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍵⍵ or ⍹&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conjunction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺⍺ or ⍶&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adverb<br>
While the definition calls for these to be verbs or nouns, there is
currently no way to recognize these formal parameters contain nouns.<p>

While this restriction means users cannot model adverbs like / or
conjunctions like ⍤, experience shows that the current limits are
a small price to pay for writing code without superfluous parenthesis.<p>

There is a new new apply conjunction (⍭).  It is actually a general
facility, but it's only use at this point is to provide an Axis variant
of the following verbs.<br>

<table border="1"><tr>
<td  width="270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ↑ ⍵<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ↑⍭{Axes} ⍵</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take<br>
the primary definition provides for a diminished left argument, as
if the axes specified is ⍳⍴⍺.  The variant definition 
applies the left argument to the axis specified dimensions.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ↓ ⍵<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ↓⍭{Axes} ⍵</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop<br>
the primary definition provides for a diminished left argument, as
if the axes specified are ⍳⍴⍺.  The variant definition 
applies the left argument to the axis specified dimensions.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ⌽ ⍵<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ⌽⍭{Axis} ⍵</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pivot<br>
the primary definition only provides a scalar left argument.  The variant
is required to provide a full left argument as well as specify the axis.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⊂ ⍵<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⊂⍭{Axes} ⍵</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enclose<br>
the primary definition works as if the specified axes are ⍳⍴⍵.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ⊂ ⍵<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⍺ ⊂⍭{Axis} ⍵</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partitioned Enclose<br>
the primary definition works as if the last axis was specified.</td>
</tr></table>
